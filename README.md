![Main window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aarnt/qtgzmanager/master/mainwindow.png)

**QTGZManager** is a Qt based GUI front end to the Slackware's pkgtool package manager.
It consists of a lxqt-sudo clone called [qt-sudo](https://github.com/aarnt/qt-sudo/) used to gain root privileges and a package browser application used
to search, install, remove, upgrade and downgrade packages.

You can read [INSTALL](https://github.com/aarnt/qtgzmanager/blob/master/INSTALL) for compiling instructions.

Enjoy!
