This is QTGZManager 1.1.0 (dev) release.

A Slackware based system is needed in order to use QTGZManager, 
as well as Qt 5.x libraries. 
Note that if you're running Slackware 15.0 or above you already have Qt5 libs.

There are two ways to install QTGZManager:

I - Manually compiling the sources:

	a) qmake qtgzmanager.pro
	b) make

The binary will be in ./bin/qtgzmanager.


II - Executing pack_qtgzmanager.sh script to get the latest dev version:

	a) cd tools
	b) sh pack_qtgzmanager.sh (needs internet access and root privilege)

The package will be generated in /tmp. Just installpkg it and you are ready.


Enjoy!
